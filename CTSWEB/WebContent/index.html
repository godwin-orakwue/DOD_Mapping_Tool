        Information contained in this system is subject to the Privacy Act of
        1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended). Only authorized persons in the
        conduct of official business may use personal information contained in
        this system. Any unauthorized disclosure or misuse of personal
        information may result in criminal and/or civil penalties. Any
        official or employee may be found guilty of a misdemeanor and fined
        not more than $5,000.00 if he or she willfully discloses personal
        information to anyone not entitled to receive information. Any
        individual may file a civil action against a DoD component or its

        <p>For site management, information is collected for statistical
        purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to
        create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as
        assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining
        technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or
        problem areas. For site security purposes and to ensure that this
        service remains available to all users, this government computer
        system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to
        identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
        otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement
        investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual
        users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other
        purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with
        National Archives and Records Administration General Schedule 20.
        Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
        this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
        Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-474, Oct. 16, 1986,
        100 Stat. 1213). Department of Defense Security Notice and Consent

        <p>This is a DoD computer system. This computer system, including
        all related equipment, networks, and network devices (specifically
        including Internet access) are provided only for authorized U.S.
        government use. DoD computer systems may be monitored for all lawful
        purposes, including ensuring that their use is authorized, for
        management of the system, to facilitate protection against
        unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability,
        and operational security. Monitoring includes active attacks by
        authorized DoD entities to test or verify the security of this system.
        During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied and
        used for authorized purposes. Authorized DoD personnel may monitor all
        information, including personal information, placed or sent over this
        system.</p>

        <p>Use of this DoD computer system, authorized or unauthorized,
        constitutes consent to monitoring of this system. Unauthorized use may
        subject you to criminal prosecution. Evidence of unauthorized use
        collected during monitoring may be used for administrative, criminal,
        or civil action.</p>

        At all times, security maintenance and administration is an essential
        element of web site operation and maintenance. This system employs
        several levels of security to protect the personal identifiable
        information. In addition, these security levels
        are anticipated to be in compliance with the Health Information
        Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (Pub. L. 104-191,
        Aug 21, 1996,110 Stat. 1936).
